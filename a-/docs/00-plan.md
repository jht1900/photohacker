# Plan
- Explain Terminal command line vs. visual interface
- - GUI (Graphic User Interface)
- - WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)
- - command line: interface is in your head
- Doc a-/bin bash shell scripts
- Give rational for using node
- - same language in command line, browser and server
- - big eco system
